		<p>Hi! My name is Kasper Andersson and I'm very interested in Linux. There is one project which has definitely heightened my interest: Gentoo. It's and operating system based on Linux which you get to build
		    for yourself from source code. This makes it very flexible as you can patch the operating system and change components as you wish, kind of like building your own desktop PC.
		</p>
		<p>
		    I've been running Gentoo on my development/gaming PC for a little over a year now and I really like it so far. Given my interest in operating systems and computers more generally, I'm very happy to be able to build my
		    very own operating system from source code and be able to use it for both work and play.
