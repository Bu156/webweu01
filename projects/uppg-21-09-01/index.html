		Hi! My name is Kasper Andersson and I'm very interested in operating systems, development and the like.
		One of my favorite projects is <a href="https://kernel.org" target="_blank">Linux</a>,
		a <u>free and open source</u> operating system kernel, often used with software from Android or the GNU project.
		A kernel can be seen as the heart of the operating system.
		It's what allows the applications on your computer to interact with the hardware and it allocates
		processing power and memory so everything runs smoothly.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	    </p>
	    <h2>What can you use Linux for?</h2>
	    <p>
		Pretty much anything you'd use any other OS for. I personally use it for a lot of my school work, producing music, gaming, development and everything else.
		It's traditionally been run mostly on servers due to the lack of desktop software, like games and Photoshop, but in recent years projects like
		<a href="https://www.winehq.org/">Wine</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton">Proton</a> have made gaming on Linux viable to the point where
		Valve, the company behind Steam, is now releasing a
		<a href="https://www.steamdeck.com/en/">game console</a> which runs Linux and is able to play almost all Windows games.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		It's also a very usable and stable OS, I run it on everything from my gaming PC to my laptop to my server, which hosts a live version of this page, a
		<a href="https://git.shrewdly.se" target="_blank">Git page</a> and a
		<a href="https://cloud.shrewdly.se" target="_blank">Nextcloud instance</a>.
	    </p>
	    <h2>Why use Linux?</h2>
	    <p>
		Sometimes I get asked why I use Linux and not a more mainstream OS, like Windows or macOS.
		There are many reasons to use it but here are just a few:
	    </p>
	    <h3>Simple updates</h3>
	    <p>
		If you use one of the more mainstream versions of Linux,
		like <a href="https://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu <img src="res/img/ubuntu-logo32.png" class="os-text-logo"></a>,
		<a href="https://linuxmint.com/">Mint <img src="res/img/leaf-badge.svg" class="os-text-logo"></a> or
		<a href="https://getfedora.org/">Fedora <img src="res/img/fedora.png" class="os-text-logo"></a>,
		updates are super simple, not forced on you (though you <u>really should</u> install security updates),
		and most don't even need you to restart your computer.
		You can even tell it to update in the background and the updates will be automatically downloaded in the background and
		applied the next time you restart you computer.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		This comes as a result of Linux traditionally being a server operating system, where you want your servers to be shut off for as short a time as possible.
	    </p>
	    <h3>Licensing</h3>
	    <p>
		Linux is <b>free and open source software</b>,
		which means you are allowed to use the code for pretty much anything you want, you can study it, change it,
		and publish your changes for others to use, as long as you let others do the same with your changes.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		I really like this model of development because it allows the people who want a function in their software to help develop it.
		You also don't get the problems of planned absolecense that other software faces, like phones not receiving updates to encourage you to buy a new one.
	    </p>
	    <h3><u>You</u> own your computer</h3>
	    <p>
		Tying into the previous point, using Linux <u>you</u> are the one who controls your operating system.
		The companies who make Linux and derivative operating systems don't make money off selling the operating system itself.
		They let anyone use their version and publish it in the hope that companies will pay for support for their servers.
		Because of this, they don't have any real incentive to collect more data than needed (which often is none) or prevent you from using certain features.
