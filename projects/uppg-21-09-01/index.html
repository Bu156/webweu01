	    <p>Hi! My name is Kasper Andersson and I'm very interested in Linux. There is one project which has definitely heightened my interest: Gentoo. It's and operating system based on Linux which you get to build
		for yourself from source code. This makes it very flexible as you can patch the operating system and change components as you wish, kind of like building your own desktop PC.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		I've been running Gentoo on my development/gaming PC for a little over a year now and I really like it so far. Given my interest in operating systems and computers more generally, I'm very happy to be able to build my
		very own operating system from source code and be able to use it for both work and play.
	    </p>
	    <h2>What can you use Gentoo for?</h2>
	    <p>Pretty much anything you'd use any other OS for. I personally use it for a lot of my school work, producing music, gaming, development and everything else.</p>
	    <h2>Why Linux?</h2>
	    <div id="why-linux-content">
		<p><a href="https://kernel.org" target="_blank">Linux</a> is <b>free and open source software</b>, which means you are allowed to use the code for pretty much anything you want, you can study it, change it, and publish your changes for others to use, as long as you let others do the same with your changes.</p>
		<p>I really like this model of development because it allows the people who want a function in their software to help develop it. You also don't get the problems of planned absolecense that other software faces, like phones not receiving updates to encourage you to buy a new one.</p>
		<p>
		    It's also a very usable and stable OS, I run it on everything from my gaming PC to my laptop to my server which hosts this page, a <a href="https://git.shrewdly.se" target="_blank">Git page</a> and a
		    <a href="https://cloud.shrewdly.se" target="_blank">Nextcloud instance</a>.
